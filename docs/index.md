The [__TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks__](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/) 
is an open source performance comparison of many web application frameworks 
executing fundamental tasks such as JSON serialization, database access, and 
server-side template composition.

For background information, see the documents linked herein about 
[TechEmpower](About/TechEmpower), the [Framework Benchmarks Project](About/Framework-Benchmarks), 
or this [Documentation itself](About/Documentation).

This documentation is organized into a few sections. Within each section we
provide an overview and links to further detail.
