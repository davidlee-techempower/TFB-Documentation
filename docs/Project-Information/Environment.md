#Simulating Production Environments
For this project, we aimed to configure every framework according to the best practices for production deployments gleaned from documentation and popular community opinion. The goal is approximating a sensible production deployment as accurately as possible. We also want this project to be as transparent as possible, which is why we have posted our test suites on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/).
